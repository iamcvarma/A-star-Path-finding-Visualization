A* pathfinding algorithm is arguably the best pathfinding algorithm when we have to find the shortest path between two nodes. A* is the golden ticket, or industry standard, that everyone uses. Dijkstra's Algorithm works well to find the shortest path, but it wastes time exploring in directions that aren't promising.

This tool will help visualize how A* algorithm works. It is fully interactive and made using Python Pygame library. Users will be able to design their own maze and run the algorithm to see how it works.
